Generate a simple, static one-page website for a sports communication and sponsorship agency based in Toulouse.

Requirements:
	•	All content must be written directly inside the index.html file using standard semantic HTML (<header>, <section>, <footer>).
	•	No JSON, no external JavaScript frameworks, no API calls.
	•	Keep everything self-contained: HTML for structure, CSS for styling.
	•	Create multiple CSS files (e.g. global.css, header.css, sections.css, footer.css) and link them in the <head> of index.html.
	•	Use smooth scrolling with pure CSS if possible. Avoid JavaScript unless strictly necessary.
	•	Responsive design (desktop + mobile).

Structure of the page (single page with anchor navigation):
	1.	Header: fixed navigation bar with anchor links (Accueil, Notre projet, Nos athlètes, Qui sommes-nous, Contact).
	2.	Hero (Accueil): full-width background image of Toulouse, with a headline: “Agence de communication & sponsoring sportif – Toulouse” and a short subtext.
	3.	Notre projet: section with a short explanatory paragraph about the agency’s mission.
	4.	Nos athlètes: grid of athlete cards (placeholder images, name, sport, short description).
	5.	Qui sommes-nous ?: presentation of the 3 founders (either group text or individual mini bios with placeholder photos).
	6.	Contact: simple form (name, email, message) + placeholder email address + placeholder social media links.
	7.	Footer: copyright line.

Design guidelines:
	•	Clean and modern, white background, black text, with one accent color (dark blue).
	•	Minimalistic but professional look.
	•	Separate styling per CSS file (global.css for fonts/colors, header.css for navigation, sections.css for sections, footer.css for footer).

Deliverables:
	•	index.html fully written with all content inline (no JSON).
	•	A styles/ folder containing at least 3 CSS files: global.css, header.css, sections.css, footer.css.
	•	Code must be clean, commented, and easy to modify manually.
